/*
- This is not for android nor ios.
- The code is pure C, perfectly compatible with C++.
- windows is fully supported from XP to 10 (maybe even older versions)
- C# & LUA via dll, see example files
- OSX supported from 10.4 to latest (maybe even older versions)
- Avoid using " and ' in titles and messages.
- There's one file filter only, it may contain several patterns.
- If no filter description is provided,
  the list of patterns will become the description.
- char const * filterPatterns[3] = { "*.obj" , "*.stl" , "*.dxf" } ;
- On windows UTF-8 is used as the default encoding
- On windows link against Comdlg32.lib and Ole32.lib
  This linking is not compulsary for console mode (see above).
- On unix: it tries command line calls, so no such need.
- On unix you need one of the following:
  applescript, kdialog, zenity, matedialog, shellementary, qarma,
  python (2 or 3)/tkinter/python-dbus (optional), Xdialog
  or dialog (opens terminal if running without console) or xterm.
- One of those is already included on most (if not all) desktops.
- In the absence of those it will use gdialog, gxmessage or whiptail
  with a textinputbox.
- If nothing is found, it switches to basic console input,
  it opens a console if needed (requires xterm + bash).
- Use windows separators on windows and unix separators on unix.
- String memory is preallocated statically for all the returned values.
- File and path names are tested before return, they are valid.
- If you pass only a path instead of path + filename,
  make sure it ends with a separator.
- tinyfd_forceConsole=1; at run time, forces dialogs into console mode.
- On windows, console mode only make sense for console applications.
- On windows, Console mode is not implemented for wchar_T UTF-16.
- Mutiple selects are not allowed in console mode.
- The package dialog must be installed to run in enhanced console mode.
  It is already installed on most unix systems.
- On osx, the package dialog can be installed via
  http://macappstore.org/dialog or http://macports.org
- On windows, for enhanced console mode,
  dialog.exe should be copied somewhere on your executable path.
  It can be found at the bottom of the following page:
  http://andrear.altervista.org/home/cdialog.php
- If dialog is missing, it will switch to basic console input.
- You can query the type of dialog that will be use.
- MinGW needs gcc >= v4.9 otherwise some headers are incomplete.
- The Hello World (and a bit more) is on the sourceforge site:
